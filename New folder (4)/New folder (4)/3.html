            <p class="text">Ah this fellow gooner I know him a bit more than those other 2 because he's an acquaintance of mine. He's VERY silly guy. He sends anime gifs in the group chat acting like some cute anime girl. Although he's kinda scary to me because usally when he says "k" or something like that he sounds so judging... I gave away him a plush of his kid Tsumugi Aoba before and he put it on his backpack it made me happy not gonna lie. He even gifted me some candy so I decided to gift him back my DandaDan manga Volume 1 and you know what he said? "YOOOO these pages are gonna be sticky" woah there, buddy! He's such a gooner for real like Robert said. I assigned him Junpei because it fits him so well. He lowkey looks like him and acts like him especially he loves goth girls and Junpei does have a lover sort of?  who's a gothic lolita girl but too bad bro ...... I won't say it, spoilers....Although I recommend this game A LOT! The OSTs are such a banger and the story too it's very well written so are the characters and this game is also is inspired by Evangelion!. In conclusion I think this gooner is most normal of the gooners out there. Oh and also he plays Stardew Valley and likes Evangelion so that's a huge W for him!
